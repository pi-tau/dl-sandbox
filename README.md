# Building models with PyTorch

!["PyTorch"](torch.png)

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of different deep learning
models. I have tried to provide implementations with extensive comments to
models described in recent papers that I find interesting. The code given here
does not aim to be production-ready, rather it could be used as a reference if
you want to roll out your own implementation.
